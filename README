Using omrjit with postgres:

Before you build make sure these files are placed properly, I have tested the code against postgresql-12.2 version. Following rules best comply with the version
I used.

1. Place the "omrjit_expr" dir under the contrib directory: "../pgsql/contrib"
2. Replace the file "execTuples.c" from "pgsql/src/backend/executor" with the one in the git.
3. Place the file omrjit.h under the dir: "pgsql/src/include/jit"
4. Replace the file "postgres.c" from "pgsql/src/backend/tcop" with the one in the git.
5. NOTE: that the CC flag (line: 256) in the Makefile.global at "pgsql/src/Makefile.global" must be gcc while you
   are building postgresql. And when compiling the omrjit_expr.so or any c++ library you need to change the CC flag
   to g++ .
6. Refer, the postgres_installation document for more into installing, building with eclipse, creating a 10Million row table and testing your queries.


PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================

This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces, many of which are listed here:

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
file COPYRIGHT.  A comprehensive documentation set is included in this
distribution; it can be read as described in the installation
instructions.

The latest version of this software may be obtained at
https://www.postgresql.org/download/.  For more information look at our
web site located at https://www.postgresql.org/.
